**Notes:**
1. Source code of the calculator has been taken from ```https://www.tcsion.com/OnlineAssessment/ScientificCalculator/Calculator.html``` and nothing is changed/altered to ensure max stability and best results.
2. Pin this extension/add-on to your toolbar of browser for 1 click access.
3. The calculator memory resets if extension popup goes out of focus. Didn't affect my workflow since we can still scroll the assignment page without losing calculator focus.
