**Notes:**
1. Source code of the calculator has been taken from ```https://www.tcsion.com/OnlineAssessment/ScientificCalculator/Calculator.html``` and nothing is changed/altered to ensure max stability and best results.
2. Pin this extension/add-on to your toolbar of browser for 1 click access, or set a keyboard shortcut on your browser.
3. The calculator memory resets if extension popup goes out of focus. Didn't affect my workflow since we can still scroll the assignment page without losing calculator focus.
